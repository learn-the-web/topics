## Stats for websites

**Be careful with tracking, the more you track about yours the more you may alienate them. Also remember that many people install extensions to disable tracking.**

Knowing statistics about your website can help you make informed design and content decisions. You can see what content is important, how people move around your website, and where they come from.

Some stats you can track:

- number of visitors
- number of unique visitors
- length of stay
- bounce rate
- pages visited
- source of traffic
- search engine keywords
- browser/OS versions

There are different kinds of stats packages you can have on your website:

1. Most hosting providers have server-side stats that give you general information but it isn’t too detailed.
2. You can also install client-side and more intense server-side stats packages to give you more detail and track lots more about your users.

## A/B testing

A/B testing or split testing is a way to get data on which of two different designs performs better. You create two variations of the design on your live website—concentrating on a specific goal—and test it with real users to see which one performs better.
