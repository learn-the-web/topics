Choosing a code editor is a highly personal choice—choose the one that you like the most.

*It’s usually a good idea to download your code editor and use it for a little while before making a decision.*

## What code editors do

It isn’t strictly necessary to use a code editor when writing your code. All you actually need is a plain-text editor: TextEdit on Mac or Notepad on Windows.

The problem with using a plain-text editor is that they aren’t optimized for writing code.

A proper code editor will provide a bunch of features to help you write and see code more efficiently.

- **Line numbers** — automatic numbering for lines of code
- **Syntax highlighting** — colouring of different keywords to help understanding
- **Indentation assistance** — helping you indent and align the code for easier reading
- **Auto-completion** — automatically add and complete code for you and show suggestions
- **Multiple file interface** — having more than one file open at a time
- **Quick movement** — moving within files quickly and opening/closing files quickly

### Important settings to consider

- `Changing the theme and colour scheme`<br>
  Some people like dark interfaces, some like light

- `Turn on “Show invisible characters”`<br>
  Will show spaces, tabs, returns, etc. to help you understand your code

- `Turn on “Indent guides”`<br>
  Will draw vertical lines to help see the alignment of code

- `Turn on “Scroll past end”`<br>
  So your code isn’t mashed at the bottom of your screen

- `Turn on “Show line numbers”`<br>
  Make sure to turn those on!

- `Turn on “Soft tabs”`<br>
  This is really a personal preference: indent with space (soft) characters or tab characters (hard); whatever you choose, the `tab` key will always work

- `Tab length: “2”`<br>
  How many spaces to add when hitting the `tab` key, or how wide the tab characters look

- `Turn off “Soft wrap” or “Word wrap”`<br>
  Whether the lines are wrapped automatically or force you to scroll horizontally

- `File encoding “UTF-8”`<br>
  How the file is written on the computer, allows lots of different characters and languages; most likely the default)

## Recommended code editors

*Here’s the top 3 I would recommend for you:*

- [**Atom (by GitHub)**](https://atom.io/) (free)<br>
  Simplest to get into, tightly integrated with GitHub, good community.<br>
  **[☛ Atom setup guide](/courses/web-dev-1/set-up-your-code-editor/)**

- [**Sublime Text 3**](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (freemium)<br>
  Most complex listed, requires a little setup, has greatest long term potential, huge community.<br>

- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free)<br>
  Comparable to Atom, many people like it better.

## Others you may like

- [Textmate 2](http://macromates.com/) (free, right now)<br>
  Going through a revival, decent community, may have to eventually pay.

- [Coda](https://www.panic.com/coda/) (paid)<br>
  Simple, made by a great company, specifically targeted at web development, some good designer focused tools.

- [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (paid)<br>
  Been around for a very long time, has some amazing text processing capabilities, not as modern looking as others.<br>
