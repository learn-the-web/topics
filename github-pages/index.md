GitHub has a hosting service for static websites. All you have to do is create a branch named `gh-pages`.

## 1. Create a branch named gh-pages

## 3. Set gh-pages as the default

## 4. Delete the master branch

*You only need to set `gh-pages` as default and delete the `master` branch if you don’t plan on using `master`. If you are just hosting a static site or a Jekyll site you likely don’t need the `master` branch.*
