Google Fonts is a free service provided by Google that allows us to use some really nice type families on your websites.

---

**Go to Google Fonts and find the typeface you want to use.**

**Press “Add to Collection”.**

**Press the little line button in the collection drawer to open it.**

**You’ll be taken to the use and download screen.**

It’s really important for website performance to choose only the weights and styles you need. *The more styles and weights you choose the slower your website will be.*

**Copy the HTML `link` tag that Google provides you.**

It’s a normal `link` tag but it loads a CSS file from Google’s servers instead of your own folder.

**Paste the `link` into the `head` of your website.**

**Go back to Google’s font page and copy the `font-family` declaration.**

**Paste the `font-family` declaration into your CSS where you want to use the font family.**
