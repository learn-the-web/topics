Part of making amazing & useful websites is planning and organzing the content in a way that’s logical & user friendly. There are lots of tools to help us understand & organize our content for the web.

## Content first

Since text & content is so important to websites we want to think about it and consider it really early in the process.

Don’t write a single line of code until you know the purpose of your website. Don’t write code until you know what is going on the pages: home important it is, and in what order.

### Content inventory

One way to help understand our content is to create a content inventory. It helps you see what content you have, what content you need & helps you understand the information of the website you’re building.

A simple content inventory might look something like this:

| Title | Type | URL | Person | Status | Location | Keywords |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Brachiosaurus | article | /dinos/herbivores/brachiosaurus | Anning | approved | CMS | dinosaur, herbivore, long neck, sauropod |
| Ovariptor | blog post | /dinos/omnivores/oviraptor | Brown | draft | CMS | dinosaur, omnivore, raptor, small |

The headings help us understand the content & its purpose on our website:

- **Title** — What’s the name of the content? What is the content subject?
- **Type** — The kind of content it is: article, image, blog post, social post, etc.
- **URL** — The content’s URL on the website
- **Person** — The person responsible for maintaing the content
- **Status** — Is the content ready to be used? Does it need work?
- **Location** — Where can the content be found in your organization? CMS, network drive, server, etc.
- **Keywords** — Keywords the content contributes to your website

**The content inventory should be a living document—at least at the beginning—always changing and being updated as you understand the content better.**

### Card sorting

Card sorting is a technique to help you organize & categorize things. You can using for lots of stuff—but it’s very effective at helping understand content organization.

Usually it’s done with sticky notes on a whiteboard or wall. The sticky notes have content descriptions and during a meeting, all the people move them between categories, suggest title improvements, category names, etc.

**The card sort helps us determine the organization system of our website’s content. What the naming? How is content grouped? How are they linked & categorized?**

Card sorting is a really good first step towards making a [Sitemap](#sitemap)

## Content prioritization

Content prioritization helps us understand what our users need from each page of a website—and what they want to find on our websites.

There are lots of different styles of content prioritization—my personal favorite, because it’s so visual, is shades of grey.

![](content-prioritization.png)

- Black — is the heaviest colour, therefore most important
- Shades of grey — darker is more important, lighter is less important
- White — is very light looking, therefore lease important

The other really popular method is just numbering. Something like:

- 1 — Search
- 1 — Navigation
- 2 — New
- 2 — Restock
- 3 — Popular
- 3 — Award winning
- 4 — Shipping
- 4 — Wishlist
- 5 — About
- 5 — Branding

**Content prioritization is a valuable tool when we do the visual design for our website.** It helps us understand how the size of the content. Whether the content shoudld be highlighted. If the content should be near the top. *More important content should be more obvious on our webpages.*

## Sitemap

Sitemaps are flow-chart–like diagrams that help us see the connections between pages on our website. They help us organize the navigation & organize how the information will be found.

A simple sitemap might look something like this:

![](sitemap-simple.png)

Showing just a top level struture with a few sub-pages.

More complex sitemaps show multiple levels of structure, interlinking & repeated content types. After doing a [Card sort](#card-sorting), we can more clearly categorize & structure the navigation of our website.

**We use sitemaps as a planning exercise for our website: to help use see the navigation, see the interlinking, see the file & folder structure of our website.**

## Wireframe

A wireframe is a simple illustration that shows the basic layout of your website. Usually just boxes & text.

It’s also really helpful to combine wireframes with content prioritization to help understand what parts of the website are more important than others.

![](basic-wireframe.png)

*This wireframe describes the layout for the homepage of a website.* Using our content prioritzation method you can tell which parts are more important based on the darkness of their box colour.

I like to use real text, as much as possible in the wireframe—but it remains grey boxes.



**Ususally you do wireframes for each of the different screen sizes you’re designing for: small, medium & large.**
