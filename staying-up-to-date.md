When it comes to web development things change quickly—extremely quickly.

**Part of our job is making sure to keep our skills sharp and stay up-to-date on everything that’s happening in The Web World.**

## Feeds & feed readers

My favourite way to stay up-to-date is by reading a whole bunch of articles and websites daily, probably about 500 or so. (Yeah, I know, I’m obsessive.)

I manage all this through a feed reader and feeds like RSS & Atom. I subscribe to all the websites I’m interested in and the feed reader automatically checks and syncs all the websites, showing me only the new articles.

### Feed readers

Here’s a couple feed readers that might work for you—test them out and choose the one that works for you.

- [**Feedbin**](https://feedbin.com/) — paid
- [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) — free
- [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com/) — freemium
- [Digg Reader](http://digg.com/reader) — free

#### Feed reader apps

I like to check my feeds on all my devices, not just my laptop, so I use an application to sync all my devices.

- [**Reeder**](http://reederapp.com/) — paid; MacOS, iOS
- [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) — free; iOS, Android
- [NetNewsWire 4](http://netnewswireapp.com/) — paid; Mac OS

I use the web application as a syncing system for the applications, and the applications are the interface for reading the articles.

*Double check that the feed reader you’ve chosen above syncs with the application you want to use.*

### Starter list of feeds

Linked below is a starting list of websites to subscribe to—I’ve culled through my list and picked the most appropriate feeds for web and graphic designers.

[**⬇ Download feed list**](https://github.com/learn-the-web/staying-up-to-date-code/archive/master.zip)

*You can import this list into any feed reader application you choose.*

### Save for later

Often, there’s lots and lots of articles that I’d like to read, but don’t have time immediately. I like to save my articles later.

- [**Pinboard**](https://pinboard.in/) — a permanent bookmarking service
- [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) — a temporary bookmarking service

## Twitter

Lots of people like to use Twitter to stay up-to-date. If that’s you, check out the list of [Blogs, companies & people](/topics/blogs-companies-people/) for a bunch of Twitter usernames.
